# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis was to continue building upon the school district analysis done in the module. This project omitted the data from 9th graders at Thomas High School. After changing the data, the data was re-evaluated based on math and reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type. 
  
## Results

### How is the district summary affected?
  After cleaning the data for the challenge, there are some differences in the district summaries from the challenge and from the module. As can be seen below, the average math score, percentage passing math, percentage passing reading, and the percentage overall passing are all lower for the challenge summary.

 ### How is the school summary affected?
  When comparing the school summary for Thomas High School from the module and form the challenge there are some differences as well. The average math score and average reading score are both lower for the challenge. Also, The percentage passing math, the percentage passing reading, and the percentage overall passing are all significantly lower for the challenge school summary. The percentages for the module were all in the 90's whereas for the challenege they were all in the 60's. These differences can be seen below.

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  As discussed above above, the removal of the scores affected the school summary of Thomas High School greatly. However, when compared to other school's there perfomance is not much different.
  
### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  1. Math and reading scores by grade
    * The Math scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School were replaced by NaN
    * The reading scores were also replaces by NaN
  3. Scores by school spending
    * Thomas High School remained in the $630-$644 bin
    * There were no significant changes made to the scores by school spending
  5. Scores by school size
    * Thomas High School remained a Medium sized school
    * There were no significant changes made to the scores by school size
  7. Scores by school type
    * There were no significant changes made when looking at the school type

## Summary 
  After removing the scores of the ninth graders' from Thomas High Schools there were some changes in the results. The most significant changes were found when looking ar the district summary and the school summary. Also when compared to other schools, Thomas High School's performance was relatively lower. There were not as many of differences as I expected and this may be due to an issue in the code somewhere for the second deliverable.
